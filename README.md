Welcome to Saint Patrick Bank Home Banking! This project aims to provide a secure and user-friendly platform for performing transactions with pre-defined user cards. Below, you will find all the necessary information to set up and use the application.

## Project Idea

The idea behind this project is to create a Home Banking platform that allows users to securely access their accounts, check their balances, and perform transactions to other cards.

## Objective

The main objective of Saint Patrick Bank is to enable users to transfer money between accounts safely and efficiently. By utilizing pre-defined user cards, we can ensure secure transactions and prevent any financial losses.

## Front-end Stack

- React (JavaScript library for building user interfaces)
- Bootstrap (UI framework for responsive web design)
- ViteJS (Fast build tool and development server)

## Back-end Stack

- NodeJS (Server-side JavaScript runtime) with TypeScript
- ExpressJS (Web application framework for NodeJS)
- MySQL (Relational database management system)

## Deployment

The front-end of the application will be hosted on Netlify, while the back-end and database will be deployed on Railway.

## Pages

1. **Login**
   - Users can log in using their card number and PIN.
   - After successful login, users will be redirected to the "View Balance" page.

2. **View Balance**
   - Users can view their current account balance.
   - Users can access the "Transaction History" page from here.

3. **Transaction History**
   - Displays a list of the user's latest transactions for the current month.
   - Contains a button to initiate a "New Transaction".

4. **New Transaction**
   - Users can perform a new transaction by entering the recipient's card number and the transaction amount.
   - Upon submission, users will be redirected to the "Confirm Transaction" page.

5. **Confirm Transaction**
   - Shows a summary of the transaction details for users to review before finalizing.
   - Users can confirm the transaction, which will deduct the amount from their account and credit it to the recipient's account.

6. **Session Closed**
   - This page appears when the user logs out or when the session times out due to inactivity.
